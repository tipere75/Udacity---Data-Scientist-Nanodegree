# DSND--Project--Avarto


## Project Overview
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households provided by Avarto Financial Services - a mail-order sales company in Germany.  

My goal was to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for Avarto. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.


## List of files
- Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb : the jupyter notebook with the analysis of the dataset  
- Identify_Customer_Segments.html : the html export of the same file

Obviously I could not upload the data because it is the property of Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.


## Aknowledgements
The dataset was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
