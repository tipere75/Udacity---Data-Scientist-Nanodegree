# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects I realized while completing the Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity.


## Projects list :
1. Supervised learning : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Charity%20ML">Finding Donors for Charity ML</a>
CharityML is a fictious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. In an effort to improve donor outreach, I build an algorithm that best identifies potential donors.

2. Unsupervised learning : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Avarto">Identify Customer Segments for Avarto</a>
I had to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for Avarto in order to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

3. Deep learning : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python-Nanodegree">Image Classifier</a>
I first developped code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.

4. Data science blog post : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%204%20-%20Stackoverflow%20project">2019 Stackoverflow survey</a>
The goal of this project is to study the 2019 Stackoverflow survey and to look into what factors are important when we speak about Career satisfaction according to this survey. The results can also be found on the following website : <a href="https://medium.com/@pierre_henin/stackoverflow-survey-2019-what-makes-a-developers-career-satisfactory-c36e969a3eb4">Stackoverflow survey analysis</a>

5. Data engineering : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%205%20-%20Disaster%20Response%20Pipeline">Disaster reponse pipeline</a>
The goal if this project is to build an API that classifies messages that people sent during disasters thanks to a machine learning pipeline.

6. Recommendation engine : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%206%20-%20IBM%20Recommendation%20Engine">IBM recommendation system</a>
The goal of this project is to build an recommendation engine for the IBM data science online community. The engin is based on user behavior and articles data to surface content most likely to be relevant to a user.

7. Spark : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Data-Scientist-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%207%20-%20Spark%20project">Sparkify</a>
The goal of this project is to predict a churn rate for a fictional music streaming service (Sparkify) using the spark environment. I want to identify the clients who might leave the service before they do so they can hypothetically receive discounts and incentives to stay.
